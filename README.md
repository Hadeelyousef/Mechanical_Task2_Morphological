I designed a simple model for the electronic parts box.

**Reason for choosing this design:**

I chose this design because it is easy to manufacture and we do not need to use a 3D printer, but it can be made of wooden panels only, and I chose wood because I thought it was the most appropriate, as it gives an aesthetic shape.

- **As I said earlier, it is a model of a box that can be used to put electronic parts inside it and not a design for the base so I did not add any wheels for example to it.**
